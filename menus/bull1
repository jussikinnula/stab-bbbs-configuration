        Script changes, see sysop.gui for more information:
          - "var" token replaced with "int" and "char" tokens. Currently it
            does not matter if you use int or char but someday it will.
            Easy hack: Search-n-replace "var" to "char".
          - Functions are defined with "int" and "char" tokens, not with
            "function". You can and should use int and char tokens before
            function's parameters, but currently it is not obligatory.
            Easy hack: Search-n-replace "function" to "char".
          - "breceive(dir)" receives files from remote to dir.
          - bg_updir-variable is no more constant.
          - BZC can handle dummy "#define foo bar" expressions, hex-numbers
            (0x42), octal-numbers (0102) and conditional expressions.
          - "sendnode(...)" takes one additional parameter, prefix. See
            bbbsdef.h/chatrec for list of prefixes.
          - bv_outputstopp is bitmapped, also replaces bv_nobreaknow.
          - "opendir()", "readdir()", "rewinddir()" and "closedir()".
          - "fflush(file)" causes any unwritten data to be written to the file.
          - BZC supports ^=, *=, +=, -=, |=, &=, /=, <<= and >>=.
          - Variable bv_vername added. It contains BBBS version name.
          - Variable bv_ver added. It contains BBBS version number.
          - Variable bv_tomenu added. It contains menu number where user is in.
          - "fgetc(filehandle)" reads one byte from the file and returns it's
            ASCII value, or -1 if end of file.
          - "fputc(ascii_value,filehandle)" writes one byte to the file.
          - "breceive()" receives files from remote to bl_newdir.
          - "bsend(filename)" sends files listed in filename to remote. It
            returns 1 if ok and 0 if failed.
          - Lot of changes in commands dealing with chat.
          - "++variable" increases the value of variable by one and returns it.
          - "--variable" decreases the value of variable by one and returns it.
          - "variable++" returns the value of variable and increases it by one.
          - "variable--" returns the value of variable and decreases it by one.
          - Variable bv_realdir added. It contains the real (OS) directory for
            bv_crrdir.
          - "fopen()" takes two parameters, filename and openmode. It returns
            file handle, or -1 if failure. Remember to save return value to
            variable and use it in fclose(), fprintf(), ... too!
          - "loaduser(usernumber)" loads user's #usernumber data to bu_*
            variables. You must use "freeuser()" to write them back to the
            disk and restore normal values. Both functions returns 0 if ok,
            or nonzero if failure. If you want to change data of a user who
            is online on other node you must send "\2UDATA" nodemessage to
            that/all node(s) after you've called freeuser().
            !!! WARNING: Using these functions without knowing exactly what you
            !!!          are doing might delete your user database!
          - "_delay(ms)" sleeps approximately ms milliseconds. Timer interval
            is about 50ms on most OSes.

            ascii 255. Available values for type are:
            - 0: Read from both local and remote (you should use getch()
                 instead!).
            - 1: Read only from local keyboard.
            - 2: Read only from remote line.
          - Indexed variables bg_zone[x], bg_net[x], bg_node[x] and bg_point[x]
            added (zone:net/node.point as defined in bcfg4://global/fidonet).
            Currently valid indexes are 0..43.
          - '$' character may not be used in variable names anymore.
            Easy hack: Just remove all '$' characters from all of your sources.
          - bc_confname, bc_description, bc_lastread and bc_status
            are now indexed variables. For example, to get the name of the
            current conference (as the old "bc_confname") you must use
            "bc_confname[bv_confnro]". In REXX you can use
            "bbbs_getvar("bc_confname",bbbs_getvar("bv_confnro"));".
            !!! WARNING: Old scripts using these variables are not compatible
            !!!          with these new indexes. They default to index 0,
            !!!          which is conference #0, not the current conference.
          - New indexed variables added:
             - bc_ulastread[x] (User's lastread pointer for conference #x.)
             - bc_ustatus[x] (User's status bits for conference #x.)
             - bc_uaccess[x] (User's access bits for conference #x.)
          - bl_spyfile const added (bcfg4/local/general/spyfile).
          - "exec(scriptname);" exists from current program and executes it's
            parameter.
          - "getnodemessage(filenum);" reads a nodechatrec from filenum and
            returns a formatted nodemessage (empty, if no more available).
          - If in multi-parameter of input-function the bit 7 (value 128) is
            set, no nodemessages are processed.
        upscript-script is run after all uploaded files are processed.

        gascript-script is run when user logs out with "g a" command.
        nodemsgf-script is used to show a nodemessage to user.
        When BBBS tries to print "\2foo\2", where \2 is ascii 2 (Ctrl-B), it
          runs script foo. This can be used almost everywhere; menus, bbbstxt,
          bulletins, ...
          !!! WARNING: Using this feature without knowing exactly what you are
          !!!          doing might crash your system!
        "\2" in bbbstxt is Ctrl-B.
        New message editor called "Script" added ("u ed s"). BBBS runs editor
          script with filename, conference number and reply-to as parameters.
          See example file for more information.
        newupass-script is run before asking closed system password.
        REXX with some extensions is supported as a script language.

          will be autocreated. If missing, default options are used.
        "X" flag in external.bbb/nodes/st disables xHYDRA protocol.
        S-key in BCFG4's conference browser sorts conferences with the same
          prefix than the current conference.

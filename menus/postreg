
Thanks for that information! Some advice if you haven't used BBBS before.

If you're not 100% sure: just keep pressing enter, the system will take
you on a tour of the more recent messages that have been left on the
system and you don't have to enter a single command!

If you want to use some of the advanced terminal features (like full screen
editing and graphics menus) these may be set using the <U>tility menu.
